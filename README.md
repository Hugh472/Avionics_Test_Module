# Avionics_Test_Module

    At my internship with Teletronics Technology Corporation in 2015, I built this test module to help ensure that on-board computers in avionics systems could handle high-stress situations with large amounts of data being streamed to them, like in crisis situations that often lead to plane crashes.  This is the version my employers allowed me to keep, as all of the information used to develop it is technically open to the public.  I didn't put it up until now because I wanted to double-check with my former employers that it was acceptable to do so. '
